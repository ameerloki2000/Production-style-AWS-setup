 ![Image Alt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/userguide/images/vpc-example-private-subnets.png)
 
 This is project which I have worked on with following aws services:
 
-VPC

-Subnets(private and public)

-Internet Gateway

-Nat Gateway

-Route Tables

-EC2(Bastion Host)

-Application Load Balancer

-Target Group

-Security Groups

This all are services that used for traffic flow,except the autoscaling and s3 gateway. 

And used bastion host to login into private instances by scp command.
